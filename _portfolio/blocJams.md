## Summary and Explanation

For this project I created a responsive music streaming application that emulates certain functionality
of applications such as Grooveshark and Spotify. I first implemented the styles and html markup, and then
added additional responsiveness with Javascript and the AngularJS framework.

## Problems

1. Create an attractive and informative landing page.
2. Setup a small database of albums and associated cover art.
3. Sort the album information and put it into a viewable list.
4. Create a responsive player module which allows the user to
   select, play, pause, and skip songs displayed in the list.
5. Implement a framework to speed up page load time and responsiveness.

## Solutions

1. Used complimentary colors to draw the eye, motivational imagery, and
   ion-icons on a landing page formatted for both standard desktop screens
   as well as popular mobile formats.

2. Downloaded a small sample of music and associated art, and used my PC to
   locally host the database.

3. Implemented jQuerys 'Buzz Library' to sort the album information with
   appropriate tags.

4. Used a bit of vanila Javascript responsiveness combined with some more
   features of the awesome Buzz Library to create a quick and easy-to-use
   player bar.

5. Switched the site over to the AngularJS framework to create an ultra-responsive
   application, and cut down on 'dead wood' code that was clogging up the source.

## Conclusion

After around 200 hours of learning, frustration, and coding, I came out with a
greater understanding of creating an application from the ground-up, how to implement
useful frameworks and external libraries, and was ultimately very satisfied with my final
product. It's clean, fast, and fun.
