## My Experience With Bloc Thusfar

My experience with Bloc in the past few months has been like the experience
of a 15th century European seaman setting sail for the New World. I took a
financial gamble with a dream in mind and faith that I could achieve it.
As of yet, I have had mostly smooth sailing under clear night skies, a couple
brief storms here and there, but overall it's been an extremely satisfying
experience.

I began with a rudimentary understanding of html and CSS principles, but
quickly learned that the little knowledge which I possessed was, to be frank,
insignificant. Within the first three weeks I was delving into the arena of
reactive Javascript coding, and building on that the winds quickly shifted me
into even deeper waters as I began learning how to inject Bootstrap, make use
of the expansive jQuery libraries, and eventually the AngularJS framework, all
of which I used to build a solid web-based application of which I am genuinely
proud of.

And now, as I am writing this post, I have reached the end of the first leg of
my journey, and beginning to write my first web portfolio. And even in these
calm waters, I'm learning how to use Static Site Generators as I create this
seemingly simple website. It just goes to show, no matter how far that an
individual can progress in the field of coding, their learning will never be
complete. Every year, existing languages are improved upon and new ones are
created. The learning curve will never truly end, which is an aspect which will
always fascinate me.
