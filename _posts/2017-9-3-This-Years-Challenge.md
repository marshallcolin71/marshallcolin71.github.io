## This Years Challenge

I've always liked a good challenge, in fact my hypothetical guardian angel
could say that I have pursued challenges in a foolhardy way, and at the worst
of cases in a self-destructive path. I've always taken" the opportunity to
better myself or, more accurately, build myself through challenges.
Growing up my parents and teachers called me "hard-headed." Whenever I was told
that a certain subject was beyond me, or that I couldn't read a certain book till
I was "of proper age," I proved them wrong and did it anyways.

This years challenge has been to learn to think like a programmer. When I told
the people close to me that I wanted to learn to code, they all looked at me
like I was a madman. To set the stage, for the last 5 years I had drifted between
construction and bartending, and had a list of unsavory people I knew and places
which I frequented that could go on for pages.
I had graduated from an arts magnet high school with very good grades, and
plenty of potential scholarships for a couple major universities, but I wasn't
satisfied with the idea of just being another 22 year old with tens of thousands
of dollars worth of debt and a relatively useless degree based upon knowledge
that I could easily teach myself at the local library for free. So thus began my
journey into the realm of apprenticeships and hard labor with my hands, which
taught me many invaluable lessons, and practical application of my mind.

Computer programming, as you can imagine, was something of a sudden whip lash
from swinging hammers in 100 degree heat indexes. But I was determined, and my
determination goes a very long way when it comes to my education. In highschool
I taught myself calculus with MITs free textbooks and lectures just so I could
build my own model plane. I was an art student at the time and stereotypically
we all had rather poor grades in math class. I broke the mould, however, as I
would continue doing throughout my adult life.

Nonetheless, programming has been one of the hardest things that I have done to
date. It's like learning a whole new language. I learned Spanish, because it was
very similar to the latin base which I had already learned French on. Programming
presented a whole new set of grammatical rules and a completely different way of
thinking and problem-solving to my mind. I am by no means an expert in the field,
but over the past few months I have obtained knowledge and taught my brain to
think in ways which I never though possible. I have proved wrong all those who
initially discredited my efforts, and have proved wrong even my own misgivings.
